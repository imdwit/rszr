offline image resizer


I have an iphone 5s so it takes ~3MB photos, which are hard for sprint to send when i'm on 3G or 1x
So this resizes them to be 500px wide, down from ~3264 Ã— 2448

Requires https://github.com/gokercebeci/canvasResize and its dependencies


Handles single image capture and multiple image selection

Select quality 0-100
Choose image(s)
it will resize and add the image to the page
then you can copy and paste or save your images
